I’m a Frontend Web Developer, Linux Enthusiast, and a 3rd-year B.Tech (Hons.) Computer Science student specializing in Data Science. 
I love creating innovative projects, including my standout work, **The AI Scientist**, which automates research paper generation. I’ve won the InFED Data Analyst Hackathon by IIM Nagpur and hold a Power BI certification from PwC Switzerland. Check out my blogs for tutorials on my projects. 
Thanks for visiting!
