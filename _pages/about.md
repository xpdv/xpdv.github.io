I’m a Frontend Web Developer, Linux Enthusiast, and a `3rd-year` B.Tech (Hons.) Computer Science student specializing in `Data Science`. 

I have a strong foundation in `Python` and I've been working onto the `AI Agentic Systems`, to automate complex tasks with the help of **Large Language Models.**

I love creating innovative projects, including my standout work, [The AI Scientist](https://huggingface.co/pradachan/AI-Scientist), which automates research paper generation & [XS Python Module](https://github.com/xprabhudayal/xs) which creates an Endpoint for accessing the open-sourced LLMs like Meta LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, etc.

I’ve also won the [InFED](https://infed.in/about) Data Analyst Hackathon by the [Indian Institute of Management Nagpur](https://www.iimnagpur.ac.in/) and hold a Power BI certification from PwC Switzerland. 

Check out my blogs for tutorials on my projects. 

Thanks for visiting!
